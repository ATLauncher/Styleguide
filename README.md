# ATLauncher Styleguide
ATLauncher Styleguide is a styleguide containing sets of components that we use across all our projects.

## Aim
The aim is to create a set of reusable components that can be imported and used across multiple projects at ATLauncher. This will keep things looking consistent and provide an easy way to get up and running visually with new projects.

## Design
The styleguide follows a few principles for it's design.

 - Prefix all classes created with `atl` so to distinguish styleguide components from other components.
 - Use BEM naming on all classes created.

## Development
To start developing the styleguide you must first install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). We highly recommend you use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage the versions of NodeJS on your system.

If you're installing NodeJS manually then please make sure you're using the latest 4.x LTS branch.

If you're using NVM as recommended then you can simply run `nvm use` in this directory to use our currently recommended version of NodeJS for this repository.

Once installed simply run `npm install` to install all the packages needed for this repository.

You'll also need to make sure you have gulp installed globally by running `npm install -g gulp` so that you can run the tasks needed to work with the styleguide.

### Building the styleguide
